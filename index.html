<p>Web development is a growing field with great employment prospects right now.  One of the best things about it is that you can learn all at your own pace, on your own time, until you've learned enough to get a great job.  No need to go into massive debt (like I did) for a Bachelors in Computer Science from a university.  You can learn it all online, without the pressure of assignment due dates, and really spend as much time as you need mastering concepts.  As long as you have the discipline to spend your free time (what's that?) staying home learning instead of going out, your future is bright!  Go, you!!  </p>
